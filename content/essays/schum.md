*A work in progress.*

There are innumerable ways to be religious. Each and every person who has ever lived has to find their own way, whether or not they adhere to a particular creed. I don’t pretend that the path I present here is better than any of the others. It’s simply the path that has presented itself to me. I hope that illuminating this path might help you on your journey.

I’ll start by saying I usually don’t feel like I fit in, whatever religious community I’m part of. When congregants think of their church as “liberal,” I seem like a silly fundamentalist. When they think of themselves as a “conservative” congregation, I seem like a raging liberal. (We’ll set aside for today the problem of importing this conservative-liberal political axis onto religion.) In debates between Christians & atheists or agnostics, I sometimes find myself agreeing as much with the skeptic as with the believer.

Why does it feel like such a struggle to fit in? The best I can come up with is that I am a skeptical Christian humanist. Each of these three terms is carefully chosen, and how they relate to each other matters. Let me try to explain.

I. Skeptical

<!-- 

In the weeks after Easter, the church readings turn to Jesus’s post-resurrection appearances. Most people know the story of doubting Thomas, who isn’t present when Jesus first appears to the disciples, and who therefore insists upon seeing—touching—Jesus’s wounds before believing it’s him.

Jesus seems to rebuke Thomas, but I tend to think he’s just joking around with him. I certainly can’t fault Thomas’s skeptical insistence on seeing some proof. After all, in the very same story, just a few verses earlier in John 20, we find out:

> Jesus came and stood among them and said to them, “Peace be with you.” When he had said this, he showed them his hands and his side.

Thomas just isn't present. Does he really merit much blame, simply because he requests the same proof that Jesus offers immediately to the others?

In my own life, I had the good grace to experience a lot of different forms of Christianity from a very early age—baptized in the Lutheran church, attending midnight mass with my Catholic grandmother at Christmas, knowing a wide range of different sorts of Christians at my school, switching from the Lutheran church to an Evangelical Free church when I was 10 or so, having nightmares about that new church, and playing shows with my junior-high rock band at the Pentecostal church in town, where my band’s weird music was just a foretaste of the much weirder things I experienced as the evenings went on.

Later in early adulthood, I spent time in eastern Europe, where I lived at a fundamentalist Baptist Bible college, and in Buenos Aires, where I attended mass at Jorge Mario Bergoglio’s cathedral before he became Pope Francis. In the Twin Cities, I attended one of those strange "Reformed Baptist" hybrid megachurches for a while, till its famous pastor’s sermon after the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami made me realize I just didn’t buy it.

Throughout my formative years, I experienced both a growing conviction that there’s something true to this story and a sense that surely it must exceed any particular articulation of that truth—though undoubtedly some versions get closer than others. I’ve had to learn to live with my skepticism without letting it dominate me.

I took a philosophy of science class as an undergraduate at the University of Minnesota. The professor, Ronald Giere, was a radical skeptic. If you made a movie about him, he could be played well by Paul Giamatti, though in terms of his disposition he was much closer to Woody Allen—cynical, defeated by life, yet still wryly amused by everything. Professor Giere, as best I remember, basically believed that every scientific theory was a narrative approximation of reality, never a reflection of reality itself. Therefore, over time, every scientific theory was more or less destined to be replaced by some new paradigm that more plausibly accounted for the facts as we understood them. (I remember Prof. Giere giving the example of how we think of earth as a globe—when in fact it's covered by mountains and valleys across its entire surface, and would hardly resemble a global at all if you're up close. I didn't find this particularly compelling. If we're only being truly honest when we inhabit the world of perfect Platonic forms, we'd miss some pretty crucial distinctions between brazen acts of dishonesty and the everyday, well-intentioned ways of speaking most people use constantly.)

Why not just let skepticism dominate?

The danger of skepticism: cynical detachment, too cool for school. Philosophy of science. Ronald Giere. Skepticism is not the same as doubt, though the two perhaps overlap.

The good influence of skepticism on Christianity & humanism: philosophical, in the best sense—a love of wisdom, the pursuit of a loving wisdom. 

The good influence of skepticism on humanism:




The great Christian skeptic, to my mind, is the French essayist Michel de Montaigne. He’s not just any old essayist, to be clear—he invented the essay, which in French means “attempt” or “effort.” Montaigne’s refrain, through the many essays he wrote and refined throughout his life, was "Que sais-je?" What do I know? He knew a lot. But the refrain was a principle of humility, a spirit of openness to the world. Without this sort of limited skepticism, humans too easily become ideological, prone to overreach and absolutism. Without a constant Que sais-je? we easily slip into unearned certainty. We too easily believe ourselves capable of policing boundaries, calling out heretics, & denouncing those who disagree.

II. Christian

<!--

The danger of Christianity is, of course, me. And you too, I suppose, if you consider yourself a Christian. 

The influence of Christianity on skepticism & humanism:

Christianity influences skepticism, demanding that we not simply critique from afar, remaining cool & aloof while things fall apart. We should be discontent with vague & trendy “spiritualities” that are unmoored from history—as suspicious of these as of those who dismiss spirituality & religion altogether.

Christianity provides a foundation for humanism. Turns out there’s not really any humanism outside of a religious foundation. 

Humanism can’t ground itself—without a metaphysical foundation and a telos, it’s so easily swayed to non-human, anti-human, and post-human ends.

III. Humanism

<!--

[Jerome? Carpaccio—Augustine in his study?]



[Jesus’s compassion on the suffering & oppressed]

Humanism is always under attack on at least two fronts:





Religious misanthropy: 

Technological antihumanism and transhumanism:

The danger of humanism: 

The influence of humanism on Christianity & skepticism: against instrumentalizing faith to “save souls” or misanthropic religion; the rejection of left-brained earth-not-humans skepticism, anti-natalism, AI-worship & transhumanism, etc
